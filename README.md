# Labb5-GrundernaOOP
C# console application made for yet another beginners programming course. 

## Assignment description
The first assignment in OOP is not very difficult, you have to create a class that calculates the area of a circle.

* Create a new project in Visual Studio (Console Application → C# → .NET Core)
* In Program.cs, create a new class with the name Circle
* The class must contain a constructor with the parameter radius and a method.
* The method should be called getArea() and it should return the area of the circle based on its radius.
* Create a new object in the Main method using your class.
* Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5 and another circle with radius 6.

### Tips
The area of a circle is calculated by radius * radius * pi

Below you have sample code that you can use to get going with the class and the variables you will use. You don't need more than two variables.
```
class Circle 
{
	float _pi = 3.141f;
	int _Radius = ;
}
```

### Extra challenge
Does the assignment feel too easy? Did you finish quickly?
* Add additional methods to the Circle class so that you can also calculate the circumference and volume if it were a sphere/ball.
* Create another class to calculate area etc. for a triangle.
